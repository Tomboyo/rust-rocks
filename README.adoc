= Rust Rocks

An Asteroids-like game built for fun using the link:https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston[Piston framework] and link:https://github.com/amethyst/legion[Legion].

== Controls

Only xbox-pattern gamepad controls are currently supported. I use a Logitech F710 for testing.

Use the d-pad to navigate menu options, the left thumbstick to accelerate, the right thumbstick to aim, and the right bumper to shoot. Press start to pause and unpause.

== Compile & Run

You must install the `SDL2-devel` (fedora) package or equivalent on your distribution. Afterwards, `cargo run` will build and run the game.

== Design

The Piston framework establishes our main game loop by generating events that our game responds two. By default, Piston generates two "update" events and one "render" event per second, in addition to player-driven input events. `main.rs` instantiates one of several instances of `Scene` to process those events; the implementation chosen dictates what part of the game the player is interacting with. Scenes define three callbacks to respond to different categories of events: The `update` callback advances game state over time, the `render` callback paints current game state to the canvas, and `on_event` handles all other events (such as controller input). Scenes communicate important events back to the main loop using an event bus; based on those events, the main loop changes the active Scene.

The Title and Score scenes are rudimentary, since they contain very little state or logic. Their only purpose is to navigate the player to and from the Game scene, where almost all of the game takes place.

The Game scene simulates the player, asteroids, and bullets that make up the game proper. We use Legion to manage all of the simulation, to include entity state and physics rules. Entities in the simulation are compositions of Components, each of which has associated with it a set of rules. Those rules are captured by Systems, which impose behavior on components every update step. For example, an asteroid is an entity with several components that store its position in space, what entities it can collide with, and how it collides with other entities. Every update, the different systems update all entities with appropriate components in order to move those entities through space, or figure out which ones have collided with one another.
